## TypeScript Generics:
- TypeScript Generics is a tool which provides a way to create reusable components. It creates a component that can work with a variety of data types rather than a single data type. It allows users to consume these components and use their own types. Generics ensures that the program is flexible as well as scalable in the long term.

- Generics provides type safety without compromising the performance, or productivity. TypeScript uses generics with the type variable which denotes types. The type of generic functions is just like non-generic functions, with the type parameters listed first, similarly to function declarations.

- In generics, we need to write a type parameter between the open (<) and close (>) brackets, which makes it strongly typed collections. Generics use a special kind of type variable <T> that denotes types. The generics collections contain only similar types of objects.

- In TypeScript, we can create generic classes, generic functions, generic methods, and generic interfaces. TypeScript Generics is almost similar to C# and Java generics.
